NexusTools
==========

Python scripts for your Nexus devices

The factoryimages.py script is a tool to flash the Google Factory Images. The scripts looks what device you have connected and downloads and flashes the newest factory image automatically.

This was quickly written together when my Nexus 7 didn't receive his OTA soon enough so there still could be some flaws ;)

Requirements
============

I couldn't be bothered with Windoze, sorry, the script currently only works on Linux.

You need to have adb and fastboot available somewhere too.
