Python scripts for your Nexus devices

The flash-factoryimages.py script is a tool to flash the Google Factory Images. The scripts looks what device you have connected and downloads and flashes the newest factory image automatically. The script doesn't wipe your device by default. However if you are coming from a custom ROM you should definitely wipe your device by adding the '--wipe' parameter.

This was quickly written together when my Nexus 7 didn't receive his OTA soon enough so there still could be some flaws ;)
